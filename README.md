# Single-Device-Optuna-Optimization

In order to optimize the parameters of a new memristor model designed to better replicate laboratory studies of Ag2S nanowires, the optuna library was implemented. The new model computes resistivity of the device as a percolation of conductive filaments. The model also featured a stochastic parameter to account for continuous fluctuations in filament volume fraction. For more information, please refer to the following journal article: "Modeling and characterization of stochastic resistive switching in single Ag2S nanowires".
